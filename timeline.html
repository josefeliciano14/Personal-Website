                        From a young age, I've been interested in anything math or science related. In fact, I would always tell people that I wanted to be a scientist. Later on 
                        I narrowed down my interests to engineering because technology became a huge passion of mine. I always worked very hard in school with the goal of 
                        being accepted into a good university and I managed to graduate with a 4.0 GPA. I had done some programming by this time but it was just a hobby.

                        The University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez was my university of choice because of its reputation with engineering. I chose mechanical engineering because 
                        I've enjoyed physics, mathematics, and machines for as long as I can remember. Even though software wasn't my major, it was still something that I kept 
                        working on because I enjoyed it.

                        During my mechanical engineering degree, I looked for opportunities outside of regular coursework and I was accepted into my university's division of the American 
                        Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. They chose me because not only was I a mechanical engineering student, I also had a background with software. My role 
                        was to write simulation software to obtain data for the stability and workspace of Gough Stewart Platforms. I wrote a research paper as part of this research 
                        which was then going to be the basis for their flight simulator design. I also did fundraising by presenting my findings to several aerospace companies on the 
                        island and attracting them as sponsors. This was the first time that what I considered a hobby had led to a great opportunity and great success and I learned
                        how useful software was in fields that were not necessarily based on it.

                        As part of my mechanical engineering capstone project, I was fortunate enough to do a project in Johnson & Johnson of AÃ±asco, PR. The project was about 
                        costs reduction. As part of the design, PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) technology was utilized in order to filter excess compressed air and generate a 
                        large portion of the required nitrogen gas necessary for various operations.

                        I graduated from mechanical engineering with honors in 2020. As was the case for a lot of people, this year came with a lot of challenges because of the 
                        pandemic. Because of personal reasons, I had to change certain plans and this led to me making the decision to apply for a second engineering degree,
                        this time in software engineering. Because it is another engineering branch, I had many of the credits already so it wouldn't take much longer to finish it.

                        One of my first big breaks in software was an internship with The Department of Economic Development and Commerce. There, I was asked by the OGPe agency to work on 
                        web development, something that I had never done before. At the time, a temporary website was being created to be used while an entirely new platform was being developed. 
                        At that time they were utilizing Wordpress but there were certain functionalities needed that they could not obtain so I was asked to step in to fill those 
                        gaps. My work mostly consisted of creating and maintaining php plugins for functionalities used by the website's thousands of users. These plugins also had to 
                        have administrative tools that were easy to use and secure so that agency employees with limited tech knowledge could modify the content. 
                        I learned about html, css, javascript, php, as well as topics such as databases and cybersecurity.
